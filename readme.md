# Django Project

This is an assessment mini-project of Back-End Web Development as part of a BSc in Computing at Dorset College. 11/2022

## Features

Log in, log out, create a user, and recover the password.

- Polls: See the list of polls, vote and see the results

## Roadmap

The main screen showing the welcome page:
This section uses a file base.html in the templates folder to be the base template of all HTML files.
I am using Bootstrap to save time on the CSS, and the CSS is loaded from an official CDN.
All the remaining pages are extensions of the base.html file.

- Log-in system
The log-in system uses the built-in user authentication system provided by Django, with custom log-in, log-out, create and recovery password pages merged with the Bootstrap template.

- Polls system
The poll system shows the user the polls and their answer, the user can vote and see the results

- Top Bar
This bar is from the Bootstrap examples and the icons changes based on the session( If the user is logged in the menu changes)

## Project

Create a Django-Python-MySQL app to allow users to choose answers from a question database.
